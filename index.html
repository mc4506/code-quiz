        <p>This is a quiz that will test your knowledge of Front End Development based on the contents you have learned
          thus far in this Bootcamp course. You will answer a series of 10 multiple choice questions within a 60 seconds
          time limit. If you answer incorrectly, you will lose 5 seconds on the clock. If you answer all the questions
          correctly before time runs out, you will get a bonus score. Compare your score with others at the end of the
          quiz. Good luck!</p>
